*Jitender* - *Kumar*

Let n be the number of samples, m be the number of features and k be the number of iterations
## Time Complexity for Logistic Regression Learniing
O(n * m * k) </br>


## Time Complexity for Logistic Regression Prediction
 O( n * m)

## Space Complexity for Logistic Regression

For storing X = O( n * m)
For storing y = O(n)
For storing thetas = O(m)

Sapce Complexity = O( n * m) + O (n) + O(m)
