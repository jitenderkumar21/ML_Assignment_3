## part (a)
Keeping mx_iter = 100 and learning_rate = 0.1
### Unregularised logistic regression
Accuracy = 90.15817223198594
### L1 regularised logistic regression
Accuracy = 96.8365553602812
### L2 regularised logistic regression
Accuracy = 90.15817223198594

## part (b)
### optimum lambda penalty term for L2 and L1 regularisation
Values of lamda considered for nested cross validation = [0.005, 0.05, 0.5, 5, 50, 500]</br>

L1 regularization = 0.5 </br>
L2 regularization = 0.5
### More important features
important features = [7, 8, 10, 21, 22, 23, 24, 27, 28] </br>
This means feature number 7, 8, 10, 21, 22, 23, 24, 27 and 28 are important.
